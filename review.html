                    above and beyond with their thoughtfulness. My father enjoys having conversations, and they are
                    happy to interact with him. I and the family feel involved and happy that he is being well cared
                    for. We have had an unsatisfactory experience in the past with other carers, so it is a vastly
                    improved service that they provide.</p>

                <p class="review_para">I am the service userâ€™s ex, and we have been friends since we broke up 35 years
                    ago. We have children and grandchildren between us. Unfortunately, my ex has been losing her memory
                    over the past two years. I visit her weekly and sometimes twice weekly. Her moment-to-moment memory
                    is now very poor, and her attitudes have coarsened, and she can be very difficult with her carers.
                    <br>
                    I am very impressed with the care she receives from the team, especially one member. They are very
                    warm, caring, conscientious, trustworthy and prepared to go the extra mile in her interests. They
                    are patient in dealing with difficulties, and they communicate well with our children, who assume
                    the main overall responsibility for her care.

                <p class="review_para">I cannot speak highly enough of the Innovations24 team. From the first contact, I
                    knew they were the right fit for my parents, and they have been as caring, helpful and flexible as
                    it is possible to be. I live a long distance from Leicester, and I have no idea how we'd have coped
                    over the last few weeks without Innovations24 to rely on, as both parents have had significant
                    changes in care needs in that time. My mum feels not only supported and safe with her carers, but
                    that she is among friends who will talk and laugh with her. She is treated with dignity and respect,
                    and as a person, not a job. It has been so reassuring for me knowing they're there for her when she
                    needs them, they go above and beyond what's expected and I can't thank them enough.</p>
